Node Use

Considerations before running node:

    1. Power on the GPS and connect the antenna.
    2. Check that there is a fix in the GPS by looking at the Fix led on it. I must blink once every 15 seconds if there is a fix.
    3. Check that the baud rate of the port is 9600, if not, change it.
        ◦ stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0
    4. Set the permissions for the port
        ◦ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

Note: The issue with the permissions for /dev/ttyUSB0 can be permanently solved by adding yourself to the dialout group. You can do this with:

sudo adduser <user> dialout

Also useful is this command for listing your current groups, although you have to log out and log in before the serial port starts letting you in.

groups <user>


Running node manually

rosrun nmea_navsat_driver nmea_serial_driver _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _baud:=9600

Running node with lauch file

roslaunch nmea_navsat_driver nmea_serial_driver.launch

Note: when running launch file for the first time check that the baud rate param is set to 9600 in the .launch file.
Note: if the import serial error occurs
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'serial'
sudo apt install python3-serial
